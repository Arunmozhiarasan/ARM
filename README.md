IMPLEMENTATION OF SMART HELMET UTILIZING AN STM32 MICROCONTROLLER

This project presents the design and implementation of a Smart Helmet utilizing an STM32 microcontroller to enhance user safety during various scenarios. The system architecture integrates several peripherals, including a GSM module for emergency communication, a GPS module for location tracking, and gyroscope/accelerometer sensors for motion and impact detection. Additionally, the project incorporates an LED to enhance visibility in challenging environmental conditions such as fog or sandstorms. The STM32 microcontroller, configured using STM32CubeIDE, serves as the central processing unit orchestrating the interaction between these peripherals. The gyroscope or accelerometer data are utilized to trigger an emergency alert system, enhancing the helmet's capability to detect and respond to sudden impacts or unusual head movements. The GSM module facilitates the transmission of SMS or data to predefined emergency contacts, providing real-time accident information and the helmet's location. This Smart Helmet project aims to improve user safety by integrating advanced sensors and communication modules, demonstrating the potential of STM32 microcontrollers in creating innovative and responsive wearable safety systems.
